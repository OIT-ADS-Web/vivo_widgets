# VIVO deployment properties

# This file is provided as example.deploy.properties.
#
# Save a copy of this file as deploy.properties, and edit the properties as 
# needed for your deployment.

# 
# This namespace will be used when generating URIs for objects created in the 
# editor. In order to serve linked data, the default namespace must be composed 
# as follows (optional elements in parentheses):
#
# scheme + server_name (+ port) (+ servlet_context) + "/individual/"
# 
# For example, Cornell's default namespace is:
#
# http://vivo.cornell.edu/individual/
#
Vitro.defaultNamespace = https://vivo.duke.edu/individual/

#
# Where is the Vitro core directory?
# In most deployments, this is set to ./vitro-core (It is not uncommon for this 
# setting to point elsewhere in development environments).
#   Examples:
#      vitro.core.dir = ./vitro-core
#      vitro.core.dir = ../vitro
#      vitro.core.dir = /usr/local/vitro/trunk
vitro.core.dir = ./vitro-core

#
# The base install directory for your Tomcat server. The VIVO application 
# will be deployed in the /webapps directory below this base. 
#
tomcat.home = /srv/vivo

#
# The name of the VIVO application. This will be used as the name of the
# subdirectory within your Tomcat server's /webapps directory. It also appears
# in the URL for the application. For example, http://my.vivo.server/vivo
#
webapp.name = vivo

# 
# URL of Solr context used in local VIVO search. This will usually consist of:
#     scheme + server_name + port + vivo_webapp_name + "solr"
# In the standard installation, the Solr context will be on the same server as VIVO,
# and in the same Tomcat instance. The path will be the VIVO webapp.name (specified
# above) + "solr"
#   Example:
#     vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:8080/vivosolr
vitro.local.solr.url = http://localhost:9080/solr

#
# Restricts access to the Solr search platform. The value is a regular expression.
# When a request is made to Solr, the IP address of the requestor must match the 
# regular expression, or the request will be rejected.
#
# NOTE: don't leave a space on the end of the line, unless you want it to be
# part of the expression. 
#   Examples:
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 127\.0\.0\.1
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 127\.0\.0\.1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
#      vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 169.254.*
# vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask = 127\.0\.0\.1|[0:]+:1

#
# The location where the VIVO application will store the data that it creates.
# This includes uploaded files (usually images) and the search index.
#

# the "Contact Us" form will be disabled and users will not be notified of

# Increase this value to support a greater number of concurrent page requests.
#

# to remain idle in the connection pool.  Default is 25%
# of the maximum number of active connections.

# MySQL.

#
# The temporal graph visualization can require extensive machine resources.
# This can have a particularly noticeable impact on memory usage if
# - The organization tree is deep,
# - The number of grants and publications is large.
# VIVO 1.3 release mitigates this problem by the way of a caching mechanism & 
# hence we can safely set this to be enabled by default.
#
visualization.temporal = enabled 

#
# The temporal graph visualization is used to compare different organizations/people
# within an organization on parameters like number of publications or grants.
# By default, the app will attempt to make its best guess at the top level
# organization in your instance. If you're unhappy with this selection, uncomment out
# the property below and set it to the URI of the organization individual you want to
# identify as the top level organization. It will be used as the default whenever the
# temporal graph visualization is rendered without being passed an explicit org.
# For example, to use "Ponce School of Medicine" as the top organization:
# visualization.topLevelOrg = http://vivo.psm.edu/individual/n2862
#
visualization.topLevelOrg = https://vivo.duke.edu/individual/org00000001

#
# Absolute path on the server of the Harvester root directory.

# harvester.location = /usr/local/vivo/harvester/
